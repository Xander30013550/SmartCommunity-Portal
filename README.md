# Smart Community Portal (SCP)

**Capstone Project â€“ Web-Based Application Development & Team Leadership**  
**Client:** *CityLink Initiatives* (fictional local government agency)  
**Project Duration:** 14 weeks (3 hrs/week) â€“ 4 sprints

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

CityLink Initiatives is a publicly funded department delivering essential community services such as:

- Event bookings
- Waste management information
- Rates enquiries
- Community development programs

Currently, their services rely on manual processes and outdated web pages.  
The **Smart Community Portal (SCP)** aims to modernise this experience by providing a **dynamic, accessible, and mobile-friendly** web platform that centralises services, announcements, bookings, feedback, and user profiles.

This project will be delivered by a self-managed student development team, rotating leadership roles, and focusing on both **technical delivery** and **quality outcomes**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Build a professional, usable prototype of the SCP.
- Improve efficiency, accessibility, and citizen engagement.
- Ensure compliance with **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)** and **WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards**.
- Deliver version-controlled code and clear documentation.
- Provide training and a smooth handover for future maintenance.
